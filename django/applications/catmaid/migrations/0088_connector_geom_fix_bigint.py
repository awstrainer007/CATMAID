    """This migration rewrites the table connector_geom. because its references
    to the connector table are wrong and need to be updated. Up to this
    migration the id column was of type int, but since it references the
    treenode_edge id column (and the connector id column), it should follow its
    type, which is bigint.  This is updated by this migration by creating a new
    table. This has the benefit that cleaning up the old table is easier and
    doesn't need a VACUUM FULL run.

    This is a new version of the already existing version of this migration.
    The existing version rewrote the table directly, which would only allow to
    reclaim space with VACCUUM FULL. Since this isn't very practical on large
    tables with many connectors, this new version is introduced. The schema
    outcome is the same and therefore no action has to be taken, if the
    previous version has been applied already.
